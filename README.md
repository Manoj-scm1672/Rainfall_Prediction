üåßÔ∏è Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts rainfall using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze weather data, identify important predictive features, and build a model that can accurately forecast whether it will rain or not.

üìä Project Overview

Rainfall prediction is an important problem in meteorology that impacts agriculture, water resource management, and disaster prevention.  
In this project, we explore a dataset containing various weather attributes and develop an ML model to predict rainfall occurrence.

 üöÄ Objectives

- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand key patterns and trends.
- Handle **missing values, outliers, and data imbalance**.
- Apply **feature engineering** to improve model accuracy.
- Train and compare **multiple machine learning models**.
- Evaluate the model using suitable performance metrics.


 üß† Algorithms Used

The following machine learning models were implemented and compared:

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- XGBoost (if used in your notebook)

üßæ Dataset

- The dataset contains historical weather information such as:
  - Temperature
  - Humidity
  - Wind Speed
  - Pressure
  - Rainfall (target variable)

> The dataset may come from the [Australian Rainfall Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package) or any similar weather data source.

 ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Involved

 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- Loaded the dataset into pandas.
- Checked and handled **missing/null values**.
- Converted **categorical variables** into numerical using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.
- Performed **feature scaling/normalization** where necessary.

 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized data distributions using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.
- Found relationships between features (e.g., temperature vs. humidity).
- Identified correlation among variables using a **heatmap**.

 3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Building
- Split data into **training and testing sets**.
- Trained multiple ML models and compared their accuracy.
- Tuned hyperparameters using **GridSearchCV** (if applied).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
- Evaluated models using:
  - Accuracy Score  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
  - ROC‚ÄìAUC Curve

 5Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction
- Predicted whether it will **rain tomorrow** based on today‚Äôs weather data.


üìà Results and Insights

- The best-performing model achieved high accuracy and recall.
- Key features influencing rainfall prediction include:
  - Humidity (especially in the morning)
  - Temperature difference
  - Wind direction and speed
- The Random Forest model showed strong robustness and interpretability.
